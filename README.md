# Java Programs: Even and Odd Numbers & Smallest Neighbor Distance

## **EvenOddArrays.java**
This program takes a list of numbers from the user and separates them into even and odd numbers.

### **How It Works**
1. The user is prompted to enter the number of elements.
2. The user inputs the numbers.
3. The program sorts numbers into two separate lists: even and odd.
4. It then prints both lists.

### **Usage**
```sh
javac EvenOddArrays.java
java EvenOddArrays
